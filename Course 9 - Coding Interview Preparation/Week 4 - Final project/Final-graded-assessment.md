### Data Structure Properties
Q: In relation to data structures mutability refers to:
- ✅ Whether a structure can be changed after its completion
- ❌ The use of one data structure as a container to mimic another
- ❌ The initial limitations on the size that they can grow to

### Object-Oriented Concepts
Q: To say that a list is an object infers what about this data structure?
- ✅ That in addition to storing items it has its own in-built functions
- ❌ That it will need to have parameters configured before use

Q: Which of the following is valid terminology for trees?
Valid terms include:
- ✅ Leaf (A node with no children nodes)
- ✅ Root (The base node in a tree)
- ✅ Branch (A series of connected nodes)

### Hash Tables
Q: In relation to hash tables, what is meant by the load factor?
- ✅ It relates to bucket capacity before a split is made
- ❌ It is how much space a hash table has
- ❌ It relates to the amount of space allocated to the index table

### Optimization Techniques
